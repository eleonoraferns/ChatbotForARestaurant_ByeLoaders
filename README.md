    The objective of this AI chatbot is to act as a tender to a customer's needs, which include, take-outs, reservations, types of meals, etc. The chatbot will use Natural  Language Processing Techniques to understand and process user input. This includes intent recognition, entity extraction, and sentiment analysis, and enables it to interact as a human. It will also be provided with ample relevant data to enhance its understanding and interaction and provide the best User Experience. It will also possess the ability to provide and suggest suitable food options based on user input.             The chatbot will be integrated with the restaurant's website and social networks such as WhatsApp for the user's convenience. It will also be combined with reservation systems, and payment gateways for hassle-free bookings and payments.
